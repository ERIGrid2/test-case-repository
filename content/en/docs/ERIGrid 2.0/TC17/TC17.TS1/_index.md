Test Rationale</th>
<td colspan=1>
<p>This test will establish the performance of the dispatch mechanism in the absence of a fault recovery mechanism by establishing the (permanent) performance loss of the dispatcher as a result of a permanent loss of one aggregator from its portfolio. This performance loss will express itself in a degradation of the dispatcherâ€™s ability to track a setpoint, and will depend on the amount of flexibility which can be taken over by the remaining aggregator(s).</p></td>

Test Design</th>
<td colspan=1>
<p>The test can be performed as a hardware experiment, a simulation experiment or a combination of the two.</p><ul>
<li>Configure grid, DER units and base load to bring system into initial state (t=t0)</li>
<li>At t=t1, request a load relief service from the dispatch unit, wait for aggregators to activate DER units. Measure the effectiveness of the service delivery (impact on grid) after stabilization.</li>
<li>At t=t2, command fault simulator to disrupt communication to aggregator 1</li>
<li>Continue measuring the effectiveness of the service delivery for a period to determine the magnitude of the mismatch between service requested and service delivered.</li>
</ul></td>

<tr>
<th colspan=1>
Initial system state</th>
<td colspan=1>
<ul>
<li>No service requested by dispatch unit</li>
<li>All DERs in neutral state (not delivering a service)</li>
<li>Feeder in overload condition by combined baseload+DER consumption</li>
<li>Fault simulator in bypass state (no fault)</li>

Evolution of system state and test signals</th>
