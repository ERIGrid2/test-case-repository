Narrative</th>
<td colspan=1>
<p>The aim of this test case is to assess and verify the reliability of failover systems in smart grids that relies on putting redundancy. Redundancy is mainly used for critical smart grid applications such as protection in substations. In general, the redundancy can be either for control systems (such as the SCADA controller), communication networks or network controller (such as SDN controller), or a redundancy in the sensors and actuators (CT/PTs, Merging units, Breakers). Specifically, this test case looks into the reliability of failover systems with a redundancy in the communication networks.</p><p>The ICT support system/communication network may fail due various reasons for e.g., component (hardware) failures, environmental failures (such as weather disruption failing multiple components), a power outage, overloading of the network (capacity shortage) or cyber-attack. A fail-over system tries to quickly detect failures and switch to backup systems (smooth transition in the case of active standby systems) or it tries to recover the system after experiencing some performance glitch (the case of passive standby system). Unlike active backup systems, in the case of passive redundant systems, there can be small system down time until the backup system is powered on and takeover.  The test case investigates the reliability of active or passive fail over systems to verify if these systems can meet the requirements (delays, packet loss or system down time) specified by the smart grid application considered or requirements set by the standards and protocols such as IEC 61850.</p></td>
